# Notes

## TODO
+ Change token types to an enumerator like ErrorTypes
+ Improve PRINT to handle more than 1 argument

## IDEAS
+ Add error advice features
    + Many errors could come with "advice": more details for the user
      about how the error could be corrected or where to look in the
      documentation for more information
+ Change Python keywords not being used to some other token type so that their
  use as identifiers can be detected intelligently and a more helpful error
  message can be produced

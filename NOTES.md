# Notes

## TODO
+ Change token types to an enumerator like ErrorTypes
+ Improve PRINT to handle more than 1 argument
+ Rework error messages and error reporting (with remedy feature?)

## IDEAS
+ Classify parsing erros into Minor/Major
	+ Parser can keep parsing after Minor errors so that multiple errors
	  can be reported on a single validation pass
	+ Minor errors:
		+ Unknown binary operator
		+ Unknown character
	+ Major errors:
		+ Bad indentation
		+ Unexpected Token
		+ Unexpected EOF
+ Add error advice features
    + Many errors could come with "advice": more details for the user
      about how the error could be corrected or where to look in the
      documentation for more information
+ Change Python keywords not being used to some other token type so that their
  use as identifiers can be detected intelligently and a more helpful error
  message can be produced

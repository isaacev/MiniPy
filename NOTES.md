# Notes

## TODO
+ Improve PRINT to handle more than 1 argument
+ Rework error messages and error reporting (with remedy feature?)
+ Currently, variables whose values change when their references changes
  won't have their new values reflected in external scope representations
    + Send JSON `scope` representation on `assign` event?
    + Include info about which variables reference other variables in
      the scope object?

## IDEAS
+ For certain errors, have a "Fix" button which will make simple changes to
  fix the error
    + Unterminated string
    + Missing end paren
    + Missing end bracket?
+ Better formatting for printed complex numbers (ex: 3.0414093201713376e+64)
  given limited space of `.md-scope` and `.md-stdout`
    + Maybe truncate displayed values and let the user see the full value in
      the element `title` attribute?
    + Strings should be truncated after a certain length too
+ Classify parsing erros into Minor/Major
    + Parser can keep parsing after Minor errors so that multiple errors
      can be reported on a single validation pass
    + Minor errors:
        + Unknown binary operator
        + Unknown character
    + Major errors:
        + Bad indentation
        + Unexpected Token
        + Unexpected EOF
+ Add error advice features
    + Many errors could come with "advice": more details for the user
      about how the error could be corrected or where to look in the
      documentation for more information
+ Change Python keywords not being used to some other token type so that their
  use as identifiers can be detected intelligently and a more helpful error
  message can be produced
